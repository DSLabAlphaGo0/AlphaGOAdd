The dataloader module presented here is a rewrite of the work by @hughperkins found here:
https://github.com/hughperkins/kgsgo-dataset-preprocessor

We invested quite some time restructuring and adding components, but a lot of ideas and inspiration originate from the kgsgo-dataset-preprocessor project, which is why the relevant parts are published under MPL 2.0, as the original project was.
