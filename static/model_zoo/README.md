# BetaGo Model zoo

Currently there is just two relatively naive bots available, both are trained with ```SevenPlaneProcessor``` on 1000 games with Theano backend. One model is trained with 10 epochs, the other with just one. Test both to see the difference in performance. The better model gets about 8% of the moves from training data right, the other one only about 1%.
